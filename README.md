# o(^â–½^)o Angular Netlify Functions Starter

This project has the bare-bones pieces to get you started adding serverless functions to you Angular application. [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/?utm_source=repo&utm_medium=ng-func-starter-tzm&utm_campaign=devex) wrap up AWS Lambda Functions so you don't need an AWS account, manage your functions alongside your app in Netlify, and Netlify handles all the infrastructure.

## Setup

### Local Setup

- run `ng build` to build out the project.
- install the Netlify CLI to run the functions locally `npm i netlify-cli -g`
- run `netlify dev` to start up the project locally
- got to [`http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello?location=Lorain`](http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/hello?location=Lorain) to see the function output
- feel free to change the `location=Lorain` query parameter to see it change.

### Productions Setup

- install the Netlify CLI `npm i netlify-cli -g`
- run `netlify init` to setup the project on Netlify & deploy it!
- run `netlify open` to open the project dashboard, under the 'Functions' tab you can find the endpoint for your function as well as see all the logs.

## The Pieces

There are two things added to the angular skeleton app in this project. A Netlify configuration file (`netlify.toml`) and a directory holding one serverless function file (`.functions/hello.js`).

Want more details on what these pieces are and why they are there? [There's a blog post for that, check it out!](TODO: add blog post).
